Client:
    The client is the same as the client from the previous
    with changes to fix the issues related to select. It takes
    an optional command line argument for both the name and port.
    By default the name and port are set to Client and 8080
    respectively. To leave the chat room, the client will send
    "DONE\n" to the server.
    
Server:
    The server takes one optional command line argument for the
    port number. Otherwise, the default port is 8080. The server
    broadcasts messages to every user that did not send the message.
    
    Running Threads:
    The main thread launches a thread on the broadcast and 
    init_client functions. 
    
    (Consumer threads)
    The broadcast function obtains a lock on both the message 
    queue and client list data structures. If there are no messages 
    in the queue, the thread is put to sleep until a signal 
    is sent from the enqueue function.
    
    
    (Producer threads)
    The init_client calls the welcome, add_client, remove_client, 
    enqueue, and goodbye functions. 
        -Welcome obtains a lock on the client list data structure
        before sending the new client a buffer with all user names.
        -add_client obtains a lock on the client list data structure
        and adds a client to the list. If the list is at max capacity, the
        thread is put to sleep until a signal is sent from remove client.
        -remove_client obtains a lock on the client list data structure
        and removes a client from the list.
        -enqueue takes in a message and client id. It obtains a lock on
        the message queue data structure. Its parameters include a message
        and client id. When the message is broadcasted to user, the broadcast
        function skips over the client with the matching client id.
        -goodbye obtains a lock on the message queue data structure and
        generates a logging off message.
